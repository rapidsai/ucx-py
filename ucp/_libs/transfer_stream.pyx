    """ This routine sends data to a destination endpoint

    The routine is non-blocking and therefore returns immediately, however the
    actual send operation may be delayed. The send operation is considered completed
    when it is safe to reuse the source buffer. If the send operation is completed
    immediately the routine returns None and the call-back function is not invoked.
    If the operation is not completed immediately and no exception is raised, then
    the UCP library will schedule invocation of the call-back upon completion of the
    send operation. In other words, the completion of the operation will be signaled
    either by the return code or by the call-back.

    Note
    ----
    The user should not modify any part of the buffer after this operation is called,
    until the operation completes.
